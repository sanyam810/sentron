    "As we enter the rainy season, your safety at our railway station is our top concern. The wet weather can pose unique electrical risks, particularly concerning live wires and electrical equipment. Please remember to avoid any fallen or exposed wires, assuming they may be live. Seek shelter indoors if a thunderstorm strikes, steering clear of metal structures, as they can attract lightning. If you notice damaged wires or electrical hazards, report them to station staff immediately. Keep yourself informed about weather conditions and station announcements. And don't forget to lend a helping hand to fellow passengers during emergencies. Your well-being is our priority, and we appreciate your cooperation.\"\"\"\n",
